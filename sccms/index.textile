        h3.. Comic Upload Directory 

        p. You can always add more comics through the admin interface as demonstrated above. The comic image files are uploaded to /media/comics on your site and the url example.com/media/comics should point to them.

        h3.. Comic Numbering

        p. Make sure your comic numbering is consistent. Presently, sccms does not check to make sure that your numbering is correct. Numbering your comics incorrectly will result in broken navigation links.

      subtitle: Where do we go from here?

        h3.. Database Configuration

        p. By default, sccms uses a sqlite database file located at the root of your site called "database.sqlite" for its database. To change this, change the @DATABASES@ variable in @settings.py@, following the instructions in the comments.

        h3.. Site Themes

        p. The templates directory contains a bare-bones example template (@comic.html@) that you should feel free to modify and style however you like.

        h3.. Need Help?

        p. Direct all questions, comments, and bug reports to "sclabs@gilgi.org":mailto:sclabs@gilgi.org.
