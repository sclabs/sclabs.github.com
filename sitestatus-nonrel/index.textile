        h3.. Update Types

        p. sitestatus-nonrel features four different ways to check the status of any given site, which you can change by modifying the "Update type" property of the Status you want to change through the admin interface. These are:

        #(padded) none - This is the default update type, which causes the update mechanism to ignore this site and never update its status. Use this for custom statuses like "coming soon", etc.
        #(padded) status - This is probably the update type you will use most. It tells the update mechanism to send a request to the url in "Update url". If the response has a status code of `200 OK`, the status will be updated to "online". Otherwise, it will be updated to "offline".
        #(padded) title - This update type looks at the title of the webpage at "Update url" and checks to see if it contains the string in "Update title".
        #(padded) content - This update type looks at the entire content of the HTTP response returned by the site at "Update url" and checks to see if it contains the string in "Update content".
