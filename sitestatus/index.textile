        h3.. Update Types
        
        p. sitestatus features four different ways to check the status of any given site, which you can change by modifying the `update_type` property of the site you want to change in the Datastore Viewer. These are:
        #(padded) @none@ - This is the default update type, which causes the update mechanism to ignore this site and never update its status. Use this for custom statuses like "coming soon", etc.
        #(padded) @status@ - This is probably the update type you will use most. It tells the update mechanism to send a request to the url in @update_url@. If the response has a status code of @200 OK@, the status will be updated to "online". Otherwise, it will be updated to "offline".
        #(padded) @title@ - This update type looks at the title of the webpage at @update_url@ and checks to see if it contains the string in @update_title@.
        #(padded) @content@ - This update type looks at the entire content of the HTTP response returned by the site at @update_url@ and checks to see if it contains the string in @update_content@.

        h3.. Domain Setup

        p. If you have a domain you'd like to host your status page on, you can add a domain to your app by going to the Application Settings page on your Google App Engine dashboard.

        h3.. Site Themes

        p. sitestatus comes with a bare-bones example template (@index.html@) that you should feel free to modify and style however you like. If you want to add CSS, Javascript, or other static files, remember to add the appropriate file or directory handlers in @app.yaml@.
